# Truehandyman-website
This was my first attempt at creating a front end React application that also connects to a Spring Boot backend for Truehandyman - a handyman business located in Southeast London.

The purpose of the backend in this application is to allow the front end to send contact information as an email to the companies email address to help with job requests and quotations.

NOTE: This was a first attempt at using react to create the website. There are still multiple improvements I would like to go back and fix the more I am able to learn.

To run this project
------
- git clone https://github.com/Alextrueman97/Truehandyman-website.git
- open MySQL and create database called truehandyman
- open the Truehandyman backend into an IDE
- go to the properties and where it asks for email address and password, enter your required details
- go to the controller and also enter the email address you would contact messages to be sent to
- run the spring boot project
- Now open up the truehandyman-frontend in IDE
- run npm start (this should lauch in browser on localhost:3000
- you can now run the website and send contact messages using the contact form.
